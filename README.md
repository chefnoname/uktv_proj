# UKTV Frontend Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The reason I took this simplistic approach was to honour the spec. I understood that the solution should highlight: - How I could retrieve what the user inputs in the searchbar - How I could display multiple 'pages' of data if there are any in the API response - How I could dynamically render component to show the different responses (films/vehicles)

I belive my solution had did this whilst still retaining the ability to be fleshed out into a bigger App with leading to spaghetti code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

# What I would of done differently/grow the app:

- If I was to grow on this application I would add routing use the name/title of the object as an id
- I would've made it so each item is clickable and routes you to a page giving more details and facts about the clicked obj
- I would've added animation to bring the page more to life.
- As the API is limited in its 'search' I would change to using radio buttons in a form-esque to bring about more data from the API
